<p>Algebraically, we have <span class="process-math">\(\curl\boldF\cdot \boldk=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\diver \boldF=2c\text{.}\)</span> Can we see this in the diagram?</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Curl. Put a pinwheel down in the first quadrant. By symmetry about the line connecting the origin to the center of the pinwheel, we see that what ever <em class="emphasis">counterclockwise</em> push there is on the lower right section of the pinwheel is matched by a symmetric <em class="emphasis">clockwise</em> push on the upper left. Thus total circulation around any small circle is zero, making flux zero. The same argument applies to any quadrant.</p></li>
<li><p>Divergence. We can at least estimate a positive divergence using flux across a small circle. Place a little circle somewhere in the first quadrant. Since the inward arrows at the bottom left of the dist are beaten out by larger outward arrows at the upper left of the circle, net flux out is positive.</p></li>

<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Curl. We can at least estimate a positive curl using circulation of the pinwheel. Again, place the pinwheel anywhere in the first quadrant. The <em class="emphasis">coutnerclockwise</em> push from the arrows at the upper right beat the <em class="emphasis">clockwise</em> push from the arrows at the lower left, giving this a positive circulation. Since flux at a point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> can be estimated by the circulation around a small circle at <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> we can estimate that the flux at any point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is positive.</p></li>
<li><p>Divergence. Now place a little disk down somewhere. It is clear by the symmetry about the line from the origin to the center of the disk that for each inward arrow there is a matching outward one, flux across the circle zero.</p></li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Algebraically, we have <span class="process-math">\(\curl\boldF\cdot \boldk=-c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\diver \boldF=0\text{.}\)</span> Can we see this in the diagram?</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Curl. We can at least estimate a negative curl at each point in the plane, by looking at the circulation of a little pinwheel. Placing a pinwheel in the first quadrant, for example, we see that the clockwise push at the top beats out the counterclockwise push at the bottom, resulting in a negative circulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Divergence. This we can see. For any disk placed in the upper half of the plane, for each arrow in at the left of the disk there is an equal arrow out of the disk directly to the right.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Algebraically, we have <span class="process-math">\(\curl\boldF\cdot \boldk=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\diver \boldF=0\text{.}\)</span> Can we see this in the diagram? A by now familiar argument easily convinces us that flux across any circle (not centered at the origin) is zero, and hence that divergence is zero everywhere. The fact that curl is zero is harder to see. Indeed, the vector field is very similar in nature to (b), where the scalar curl is positive. This indicates the limitations of our ability to “see” curl in a vector field diagram!</p></li>
